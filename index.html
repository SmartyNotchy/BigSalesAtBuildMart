      <h1>Big Sales At Build Mart</h1>
      <p>
        It's Black Friday, and business is booming at Build Mart, Inc! Hand-drawn paintings
        are proving to be especially popular, and the supply of them has quickly run out. As
        the only artist in Build Mart, you'll have to keep up with the painting orders as they
        come in. Build Mart closes in five minutes, though, so people are impatient to get their
        paintings and will pay less for them the longer you take. Try to fulfill as many orders
        as possible before the five minutes run out!
      </p>
      <p>
        TL;DR: Make as many paintings as possible in five minutes. Values of paintings decrease
        the longer you spend on them.
